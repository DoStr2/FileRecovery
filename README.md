The program is written in Python and is capable of recovering files that have been deleted from the disk â€” even after being removed from the Recycle Bin. It identifies data sectors that have not yet been overwritten and uses file signatures (Magic Numbers) to detect file types, enabling recovery even when the regular file system is inaccessible.
In addition to the recovery functionality, the program includes a mechanism for transferring the recovered files to another computer using client-server communication.
